# Don't connect 2.5
A simple puzzle game with only a singular rule: **Don't place a block so you can make a line of 3 in the next move!**  
The main focus is just being fun and relaxing. You can also try to beat the highscores in each mode!

## Features
- **Multiple Gamemodes:** Endless, Hardcore (no mistakes) and Find Last.
- **Daily Challenges** and **Medals** for each Mode. Medals are earned by getting a new highest level, or by beating timed modes faster!
- **Custom games**
- All levelgrids are **randomly generated** (procedual). Which means that you can replay a level set by replaying the same seed!
- This is a vanilla js web game. I tried to keep it small so its ~300kb big. It could be smaller by minifying the code and further reducing the 180kb sounds, but its good enough.
